Mod by ProAtWorkHere, Garfu & Downtime
Based on the Something Awful Goon edition of Eastern Sun 3.00RD

Changelog:

2024/01/03:
----------------------
MAJOR BALANCE CHANGES:
----------------------

* Monster HP no longer rolls over after ~800k.
* Damage reduced by x% cap increased to 90% (monster and player).
* Absorb% cap increased to 98% (monster and player). Absorb% no longer heals, and as a result it now functions as a secondary layer of resistance. Flat absorb still heals.
* Poison Length Reduction cap increased to 95% (monster and player).
* Unique/Champs no longer gain a small level boost or bonus HP (causes various rollovers).
* Negative resistance values no longer have a cap to them, allowing them to scale past -100%.
* Skills no longer consume ammo.
* Melee weapon ranges increased significantly, with 2H weapons receiving larger increases.
* All weapon base damage values have been doubled.
* Most weapon speeds have been increased.
* Strength and Dexterity bonus to melee damage has been increased by 50%.
* All sources of magic damage and most non-weapon-based sources of physical/wind skill damage no longer rollover at ~83k. Should cap at 8.3 million like F/C/L/P.
* Skills no longer have prerequisites, to properly support charge skill synergies for classes that possess those skills.
* Almost all current sources of Absorb% have been replaced with other modifiers, as Absorb% has been repurposed as a highly desirable modifier on certain new items and skills.
* Monsters can now drop more than 6 items from their loot tables. This mostly affects a handful of pre-existing monsters, and all the new ones.
* Crushing blow has been removed almost entirely, and replaced with a source of multiplicative attack speed scaling.
* Maximum level of skills factoring in +skills is now 110.

---------------------------------------
GENERAL CHANGES AND ADDITIONS:
---------------------------------------

* 26 new cube materials.
* 60+ new uniques.
* 6 new runewords.
* Dozens of skills improved and made more powerful.
* 36 new areas accessible by special map tokens, with 6 tiers of difficulty. Hell Nihlathak has a chance to drop a random Tier 1 map token.
* 6 new bosses.
* 6 new uber skills obtained from the new bosses.
* 52 new monsters with multiple new skills.
* Upgradeable Melee Splash Stones, a charm providing all melee skills with AoE.
* New charms that come with a high-level CtC on Striking skill, can be upgraded to add synergy skills as charges.
* A new multistocker for stat/skill pots, nirvana grass, mtn dew and the new crafting materials. Sold by Gheed.
* Decal stocker has been removed to make space for new multistocker.
* Aura versions of Assassin charge-generating skills.
* A small selection of cosmetic-only effects earned from boss kills.
* Set items have had their transforming skills removed to make space for more useful stats.
* The Act 2 and 3 town respawn points have been changed to be in a more convenient location.
* Shrine effects are no longer removed by curses.
* Shrine effects can now stack with other different shrine effects.
* The level cap has been increased to 110. Progression after 108 is extremely slow!
* The item level of the top-tier class rings and amulets has been increased to ilvl 80 to account for the increased level cap. You will now ideally want to gamble these items at level 84.
* Sources of magic resist and maximum magic resist have been increased, and several existing and new items now grant it.
* Several monsters whose exp values were bugged are fixed and properly grant experience.
* Tinker recipes now grant 3x the old amount of stats per use. In addition, the caps on certain tinkered stats have been increased:
	+HP increased to 600
	+MP increased to 600
	Added Fire increased to 500-1500
	Added Ltng increased to 500-1500
	Added Cold increased to 750-1500
	Damage Reduced and Magic Damage Reduced increased to 50
	Life Regen increased to 2000
* All existing normal/exceptional/elite uniques have been given an additional +1/2/3 allskills, and most gooniques have been given an additional +4.
* All Assassin traps now properly scale their effects based on your -resist and skill damage modifiers.
* Ancient Scroll recipe 40 has been disabled, and all sources of devil food points have been normalized to 1 across the board. DFP will be repurposed in a later release.
* Exclusive pet types have been removed, and all previously exclusive pets can now co-exist.
* You can no longer right-click a ring/amulet contract to perform a respec.
* Akara now sells full rejuvenation potions for 1.5 million gold.
* Added a special recipe applied to any ring that allows you to add cooldown frames to Teleport, letting you adjust it's recasting frequency to account for latency and avoid mis-targeted teleporting.
* Several existing unique items have had various new stats added to them, or values adjusted to be more relevant.
* Unique charm to maple recipe has been disabled.

---------------------------------------------------------------
KNOWN ISSUES
---------------------------------------------------------------

* Corpsefire and Bishibosh do not drop set items as the other SuperUnique monsters before The Monastary do due to an obscure bug. Rakanishu is your best bet for obtaining early-game sets.

* Some magic and rare items that drop from these two SuperUniques can have incorrectly-named modifiers at much higher levels than intended, however these also come with the expected level requirement, so their impact is minimal currently.

* Loading into the new areas can take some time, it is expected for the game to appear to hang while travelling to these areas. This is being worked on.

* The noob charm cannot have it's granted skill changed via the cube. This is a temporary measure to prevent a server crash and will be re-enabled at a later date.

---------------------------------------------------------------
NEW STATS
---------------------------------------------------------------

* Magic pierce
* Physical/Wind pierce
* Poison absorb%
* Physical absorb%
* Cooldown reduction
* Increased effect of fire skill synergDiablo 2: Eastern Sun Eclipse Release 2.00

---------------------------------------------------------------
QUICK GUIDE TO NEW CONTENT
---------------------------------------------------------------

* A PDF of all new recipes is included

* If you're going with melee skills, make sure to keep the melee splash charm on you at all times. It can be upgraded 3 times over the course of the early-mid game, the recipes can be found in the included recipe list PDF. The charms do not stack their effects, so having multiple of them is unnescessary.

* Tinkering now gives more stats per use. Even just a small amount of tinkering on your leveling gear can make a big difference to survivability and the damage of attack-based skills. Eventually, once you reach maps, you'll want to make it a priority to max Damage Reduced and Magic Damage Reduced tinkers on your gear as you progress through the map tiers, in addition to Life Regen and HP.

* Maps are dropped by Hell Nihlathak, with a fairly high drop rate. He only drops tier 1 maps, you will need the new materials (Diabolic Diabolite, Mephitic Malachite, Anguishing Andalusite, Pained Petalite, Baleful Bastnasite, Convoking Covellite) dropped in maps only to upgrade the tier to access harder content. Maps are not consumed on use, and when upgraded you will keep a copy of the map you upgraded from. Maps can only upgrade to the next tier of that type of map. Tier 6 maps can be turned into a 1-time-use token that will allow you to fight the Lord of that map's domain.

* Maxing your resist caps is extremely important, and magic resistance is far more important than ever before. Tier 6 maps will eat you alive if you do not have these fully maxed out, and overcapping your resists is advised as some monster skills can lower them temporarily.

* Hell Nihlathak can drop Tinkerer's Dream, a new charm that can be tinkered like regular equipment, and also has special exclusive dstoning modifiers to assist with various defensive stats.

* Radiance now has two counterparts that deal cold and lightning damage. All three can be crystallized, and placed into a new kind of sword that will allow you to have all 3 effects at once. This sword is the only item that can have these crystals socketed.

* Nexus helms are a special helmet type that can have Nexus Prisms socketed into them. These prisms can only be socketed in Nexus helms. These grant a variety of auras and stats. Auras of the same type can stack, and their levels are added.

* Monsters in maps cannot be stunned, flinch or be knocked back and are extremely difficult to freeze and chill. They have multiple skills, are faster and more aggressive than non-map monsters, and each map can have up to a dozen different monsters types within them. Being swarmed is a great way to die very quickly.

* The 6 new uber bosses have three phases. Upon defeating a phase, a stronger version of the boss arises, and their skills become deadlier and new skills are granted to them. In addition, they will begin summoning minions periodically, and will not stop doing so until they are defeated. If you allow them to live too long, you may find yourself overwhelmed by them. Uber bosses also ignore your pets and will focus solely upon you.y bonus
